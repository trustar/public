# Pulsar

For Pulsar, we are working with an end-to-end encrypted communications technology called Kodex, developed by our friends at [Kryptnostic](https://www.kryptnostic.com).

To get started, log into the Station and head to the Pulsar tab:

## Step 1

**NOTE:** If you already set up your Alias, you can skip to Step 2.

Here you will see a form to help you set up your Pulsar account. All you need is an Alias and a password. The password can be the same password you already use to log into the Station, or something new.

Start by choosing an Alias. Your Alias is how you will be known to others within Pulsar. We recommend you do _not_ use your name or your company's name in order to preserve anonymity.

After you've chosen an Alias enter your password and hit "Submit."

**NOTE:** Aliases must be unique.

If your Alias is already taken we will let you know:

If not then you should be good to go. After setup is complete you will be shown the log-in window.

## Step 2

Now you should see the Kodex window prompting you to log in with your Alias. Your Alias is always visible in the upper right-hand corner:

Enter your credentials and log in:

Now you you're all set.
