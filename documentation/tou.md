In the event Client desires Provider to provide additional services, (i.e., services other than the Services), including, without limitation, custom software development, enhanced implementation or integration, or the like, a separate, written agreement will be required.
   2. **Set up.** Client is solely responsible for all hardware, network and other equipment required by Client and/or its Authorized Users for implementation and use of the Services.
   3. **Service Level.** Service level terms and conditions are set forth in attached Exhibit B.

2. **Ownership Rights.**
   1. Client hereby acknowledges and agrees that its rights, and those of its Authorized Users, to access and utilize the System and receive the Services are strictly limited to those expressly set forth herein, and, as between Client and Provider, all other rights, title and interest in and to the System, the Services, all Client Published Data outside of Client Private Enclave, and any related intellectual property rights, are, and shall remain, the sole property of Provider.

   2. **Ownership of Data.** As between the Parties, Client shall be the sole owner and controller of all Client Data and Client Published Data restricted to a Client Private Enclave. The Provider shall be the sole owner and controller of all other Client Published Data. However, Provider will not sell, assign, lease or otherwise transfer, dispose of or provide Client Data to third parties.

   3. Neither Client, nor Authorized User, shall attempt, directly or indirectly, or allow any third party to attempt, to copy, modify, duplicate, create derivative works from, republish, co-brand, reverse compile or engineer, disassemble, download, transmit, rent, distribute or otherwise utilize all or any portion of the Services and/or System in any form or media or by any means whatsoever, except that a Client or Authorized User may copy or download data from the System solely for Client’s or Client Authorized User’s internal business use as contemplated by this Agreement or for any other use authorized by this Agreement.

Provider hereby grants Client a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, license (with right to sublicense) to use its Prior Works during the Term of this Agreement and applicable Statement of Work as necessary to receive the Services. Nothing contained herein shall prohibit Provider from using any of Provider’s general knowledge to perform similar services for others.

   5. The provisions of this Section 2 shall survive any termination of this Agreement.

3. **Payment.** Any payment due to Provider shall be made by Client following receipt of Provider’s correct itemized invoice(s). The fees for Services specified in the applicable Statement of Work issued hereunder shall be guaranteed for the Term outlined in the applicable Statement of Work.

4. **Confidential Information.**

Recipient shall not use, copy, publish, distribute or disclose it to others, nor allow or authorize anyone else to do so, without Discloser’s prior written approval, such approval to be withheld, delayed or conditioned by Discloser in its sole discretion. Neither Recipient nor its Authorized Users shall directly or indirectly make use of Confidential Information except as expressly authorized under this Agreement. Recipient shall (except as provided for herein) promptly return Confidential Information to Discloser upon Discloser’s reasonable request. For clarity, Client Published Data that is not restricted to a Client Private Enclave shall not be considered Confidential Information for purposes of any obligation, duty, requirement, or prohibition imposed by this Agreement.

    2. In the event that Recipient is made or becomes aware of any instance of unauthorized use or disclosure of the Discloser’s Confidential Information, Recipient agrees to notify Discloser of the same and to take such steps as may be reasonably directed by Discloser to prevent the recurrence of such unauthorized use or disclosure, and to mitigate any damages arising from the unauthorized use or disclosure. Furthermore, Recipient will cooperate with Discloser in pursuing any of Discloser’s legal remedies against third parties that have impermissibly accessed or used the disclosing Party’s Confidential Information that was in the possession of Recipient or its subcontractors, if any. The Parties hereto specifically agree that any breach of this Section 4 may result in irreparable harm. If a court of competent jurisdiction finds that Recipient has breached any of such obligations, Recipient agrees that, without any additional findings of irreparable injury or other conditions to injunctive relief, it will not oppose the entry of an appropriate order compelling its performance and restraining it from any further breaches (or attempted or threatened breaches).

    3. Provider will not disclose details of relationship with Client except that Provider can list official corporate logo of Client within the TruSTAR System as a participating Client and display official corporate logo of the company on Provider corporate website under the section devoted to participating Clients.
